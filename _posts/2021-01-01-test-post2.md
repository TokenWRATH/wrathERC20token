This is the introductory post to the project. This project aims at the creation of a safe ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network with many anti scam features to let people trust it without fears of "rug pulls". The very reason this token exists and the reason it's called this way was born exactly because of the existance of many scams and dangers when dealing with cryptocurrencies and especially Ethereum tokens. More poetically speaking, the name is derived from the same feeling that one may experience when finding out they have been scammed and that they have lost their capital. Everything else will be explained in the whitepaper that is still under development.

#### Current Status:
Currently The project is still in development and the development is going nicely. In the whitepaper many things related to the token will be explained, especially code related explanations and more technical topics; therefore, the whitepaper will be published around the time the code of the token is completed and fully tested to verify its integrity and security.

This website will also be filled with many other related news and topics.
