This is the introductory post to the project. This project aims at the creation of a safe ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network with many anti scam features to let people trust it without fears of "rug pulls". The very reason this token exists and the reason it's called this way was born exactly because of the existance of many scams and dangers when dealing with cryptocurrencies and especially Ethereum tokens. More poetically speaking, the name is derived from the same feeling that one may experience when finding out they have been scammed and that they have lost their capital.
